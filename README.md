# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using Power BI for visualization and SQL queries for quality control (QC) checks. The dashboard provides insights into key sales metrics such as total revenue, average order value, number of pizzas sold, order trends by time and day, and revenue distribution across pizza categories and sizes.

## Key Features

- **Total Revenue Calculation**: Summed total sales from all pizza orders.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of unique orders.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: Total count of pizzas ordered.
- **Order Insights**:
  - Total number of distinct orders.
  - Average number of pizzas per order.
  - Orders grouped by day of the week.
  - Orders grouped by hour of the day.
- **Revenue Breakdown**:
  - Total revenue and percentage breakdown by pizza category.
  - Total revenue and percentage breakdown by pizza size.

## Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard showcases these insights with visual representations such as:
- Line charts for daily and hourly order trends.
- Pie charts for revenue distribution by pizza category and size.
- KPIs displaying total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold.

## Quality Control (QC) Checks

The following QC checks were performed using SQL to ensure data accuracy:

- Calculated the total revenue from all pizza sales.
- Computed the average order value by dividing total revenue by the number of distinct orders.
- Summed the total number of pizzas sold.
- Counted the total number of distinct orders.
- Determined the average number of pizzas per order.
- Grouped orders by day of the week and calculated the total number of orders per day.
- Grouped orders by hour of the day and calculated the total number of orders per hour.
- Calculated total revenue for each pizza category and its percentage of overall revenue.
- Calculated total revenue for each pizza size and its percentage of overall revenue.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis includes transactional information on pizza sales such as order IDs, order dates, pizza categories, sizes, quantities, and total prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive reporting.
- **SQL**: For data validation and QC checks.
